/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Finwise Compass
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with subcollections for financialGoals, budgets, investments and chatMessages.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No public listing of any collections.
 * - All write operations require a verified user identity (request.auth != null).
 * - Data consistency between the path and the document's internal fields is enforced on create and update.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The userId is implicitly denormalized by being part of the path for all user-owned data. This enables simpler, more performant security rules by avoiding the need for additional `get()` calls to check ownership.
